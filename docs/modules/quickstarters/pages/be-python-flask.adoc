= Backend Python Flask Quickstarter (be-python-flask)

The project supports generation of Python Flask project boilerplate and quick
installation and integration of it with OpenShift CD pipelines.

== Purpose of this quickstarter

The quickstarter comes with a simple API-server example written in Python and using Flask framework.
The package allows easily build a Python project, using different Python modules
and frameworks.
It contains the basic setup for Docker, Jenkins, SonarQube and OpenShift.

* https://gunicorn.org/[gunicorn]
* http://flask.pocoo.org/[flask]

== Usage - how do you start after you provisioned this quickstarter

The project is production ready when deployed in OpenShift thanks to gunicorn.

It is strongly recommended when you are developing a Python project to use separated environments.
For this purpose usually one can use Python's
https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/venv.html[venv] core package (check how to use it in the next steps).

NOTE: since the version of Python is 3.8, ensure your system's python executable is also in version 3.8

[source,bash]
----
# Create virtual environment 'mylocaldevelopment' (will be located in the folder mylocaldevelopment) (run only once)
python -m venv mylocaldevelopment

# Initiate virtual environment for the project (every time)
source mylocaldevelopment/bin/activate

# Runs installation of required modules in the virtual environment (run only once)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start your application
PYTHONPATH=src python src/main.py

The following are typical xref:quickstarters:metadata.adoc[metadata] values that can be used for components based on this quickstarter:
Note that the xref:jenkins-shared-library:labelling.adoc[OpenShift resources will be labeled] based on this metadata.

```yaml

== How this quickstarter is built through Jenkins

The Jenkinsfile is provisioned with this quick starter to ease CI/CD process. In Jenkinsfile, there are various stages:

* *Prepare Test Suite* - Prepares the virtual environment for testing and linting:
+
[source,bash]
----
  pip install -r tests_requirements.txt
----

* *Lint* - Runs mypy and flake8 for increasing code quality:
+
[source,bash]
----
  mypy src
  flake8 --max-line-length=120 src
----

* *Test* - Runs pytest and generates xUnit and code coverage reports:
+
[source,bash]
----
  PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest --junitxml=tests.xml -o junit_family=xunit2 --cov-report term-missing --cov-report xml --cov=src -o testpaths=tests
----

* *Build* - Builds the application: copies src folder into docker/dist folder.

== Builder agent used

This quickstarter uses https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-quickstarters/tree/master/common/jenkins-agents/python[Python] builder agent Jenkins builder agent.
