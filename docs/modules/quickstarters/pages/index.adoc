== Overview

Quickstarters are basically templates that help to start out with a component quickly.
A quickstarter provides a specific technology, potentially with a framework setup already, such as Java with Springboot in the case of the `be-java-springboot` quickstarter. Compared to starting out from scratch, using a quickstarter typically helps by:

- setting up a repository in Bitbucket with webhooks to trigger Jenkins builds
- shipping a `Jenkinsfile` with a pipeline that builds and deploys the component (delegating most of the work to the xref:jenkins-shared-library:component-pipeline.adoc[shared library])
- providing a basic test setup with xUnit reports and code coverage
- integrating with SonarQube out-of-the-box (including code coverage report)
- setting up OpenShift resources to build and run the component
- creating a boilerplate application with one or more sample endpoints

Quickstarters are used from the https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-provisioning-app[Provisioning App], which allows to add a component to an existing project by running a quickstarter from the configured list of available quickstarters. This list can contain quickstarters from the official repository, https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-quickstarters[ods-quickstarters], or from some other repository such as internally hosted ones in your Bitbucket instance.

== Authoring quickstarters

As mentioned above, it is possible to supply your own quickstarters. Pleasee see the xref:authoring-quickstarters.adoc[authoring quickstarters] guide on how to make completely new quickstarters or how to adapt existing quickstarters to your needs.
