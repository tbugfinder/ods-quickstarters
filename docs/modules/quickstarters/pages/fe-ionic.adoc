= Frontend Ionic (fe-ionic)

Ionic quickstarter project

== Purpose of this quickstarter

This quickstarter generates an Ionic 6.13.1 project, you can use it when you want to develop a cross platform mobile app (iOS, android and PWA) in one codebase using Web technologies like CSS, HTML and JavaScript/Typescript.

It contains the basic setup for https://www.docker.com/[Docker], https://jenkins.io/[Jenkins], https://www.sonarqube.org/[SonarQube] and https://www.openshift.com/[OpenShift], so you have your CI/CD process out of the box.

== What files / architecture is generated?

The files are generated using https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/[Ionic CLI]. It scaffolds a tabbed app containing 3 basic pages (home, about and contact).

== Frameworks used

* https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/[Ionic CLI]
* https://ionicframework.com/docs/[Ionic Framework]
* https://angular.io/[Angular]
* http://www.typescriptlang.org/[Typescript]

== Usage - how do you start after you provisioned this quickstarter

As pre-requisite you'll need to have installed:

* https://nodejs.org/en/download/[node]
* npm which is bundled with the node installation
* https://git-scm.com/downloads[git]
* Ionic CLI globally in your local environment by running: `npm install -g @ionic/cli`

Once you have you developer environment set up you can simply:

* Clone your generated git repository and `cd` to your folder
* Run command `npm install` in project directory to install npm dependencies.
* Run `ionic serve` command to start the dev server, it will open your browser at `+http://localhost:8100/+`

To develop an *iOS* application, you'll need to setup your developer environment as suggested in this https://ionicframework.com/docs/installation/ios[guide].

For *android* support configure your environment like this https://ionicframework.com/docs/installation/android[guide].

=== Metadata

The following are typical xref:quickstarters:metadata.adoc[metadata] values that can be used for components based on this quickstarter:
Note that the xref:jenkins-shared-library:labelling.adoc[OpenShift resources will be labeled] based on this metadata.

```yaml
name: <the component id (this is the default, if omitted)>
description: "My Ionic-based mobile app"
supplier: https://example.com
version: 1.0.1
type: ods
role: frontend
runtime: ionic
runtimeVersion: 6.13.1
```

== How this quickstarter is built thru Jenkins

The `Jenkinsfile` contains the configuration that customizes the core pipeline implemented by https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-jenkins-shared-library[jenkins shared library].

When the code in your git repository is updated the `Jenkinsfile` comes into action with the following main stages for this quickstarter:

* *Build* - Installs the dependencies of your project with `yarn install`, generates the build by running `npm run ionic:build`, if the merged git branch is master it creates the production build with `npm run ionic:build --prod`. Finally, it copies the output folder `www` into `docker/dist`.
* *Unit Test* - Runs unit test cases by executing `yarn test` command. If any test fails, the build is marked as failed. This will also create test coverage analysis data which will then be transfered to SonarQube.
* *Lint* - Profiler that ensures code best practices by running `npm run lint` command, if linting is not passing, the build is marked as failed also.
* *SonarQube Analysis* - Triggers a code quality analysis by transfering code and test coverage analysis data to SonarQube. By default files like `*.spec.ts`, `*.modules.ts` and `src/environments/**` are excluded from the analysis, since they usually don't contain logic. Please revisit `sonar-project.properties` to configure analysis inclusions and exclusions according to your project's needs.

== Builder agent used

This quickstarter uses https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-quickstarters/tree/master/common/jenkins-agents/nodejs16[Node.js 16 builder agent] for Jenkins.

== Known Limitation

Ionic Pro builds needs to be configured separately as described https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-quickstarters/blob/5da91c9d190b0eb96bf53b393e355e355e18bfdf/boilerplates/fe-ionic/files/README.md[here]
