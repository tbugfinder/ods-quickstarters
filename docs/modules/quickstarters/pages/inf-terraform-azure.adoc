= Infrastructure Terraform Azure Quickstarter (inf-terraform-azure)

The project supports generation of Azure deployments utilizing terraform tooling,
installation and integration of it with OpenShift CD pipelines.

== Purpose of this quickstarter

The quickstarter comes with a sample terraform which deploys a resource group and a storage account via an ARM template. 
This is a showcase to elaborate the combination of both technologies.

The quickstarter includes kitchen-terraform with Chef InSpec / cinc-auditor for testing.
